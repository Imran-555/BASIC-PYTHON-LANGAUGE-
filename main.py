# 1) for print any string use print(" ") for example
print("MY NAME IS JHON ")


# for print any value we do'nt use ""  for example
a=5          # 5 is store in a variable "a"
print(a)     # print the value of "a"



# 2) use of operator  (+ - * / )
num1= 12             #12 is store in variable name "num1"
num2=15              #12 is store in variable name "num2"
print(num1+num2)     #use of +
print(num1-num2)     #use of -
print(num1*num2)     #use of *
print(num1/num2)     #use of /




                       ## 3) use of Input function , we use input to take input by user ##

#take string as input
name=input("Please Enter Your Name ")  #this will store the input in the variable "name"
print("Welcome " + name)


#take integer value as input
#use int before the function input as example
value=int(input("Enter the value "))   #It will take input as integer and store it in the variable name "value"




#program using input function
# addition of two number
first=int(input("Enter the first number : "))
second=int(input("Enter the second number : "))
print("The sum of first and second number : ")
print(first+second)
